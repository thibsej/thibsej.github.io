After graduating from Ecole Polytechnique, I enrolled into the master's degree MVA ("Mathematiques, Visison, Apprentissage") of Ecole Normale Superieure Paris-Saclay. I am now a second year PhD candidate at ENS Paris under the supervision of [Gabriel Peyré](http://www.gpeyre.com/) and [François-Xavier Vialard](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~vialard/). I am currently working on the applications of the theory of Optimal Transport for Machine learning applications.
